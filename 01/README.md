Homework 01 - Practice set
===============================================================================

Don't forget to check the [labs repository](https://github.com/2015-Fall-UPT-PLDA/labs) for transcripts of what we talked about. The [Haskell cheat-sheet](https://github.com/2015-Fall-UPT-PLDA/labs/blob/master/haskell-cheat-sheet.md) is also a good thing to have at hand.

Homework submission guidelines, and due date
-------------------------------------------------------------
The deadline is the end of the week 2 lab, _*Wednesday October 7th, 2015 at 20:00*_.  It is recommended to finish the problem set before next week's lab, just so you will have had enough practice with the language.

You should show either me, or Marius a `.hs` file with working implementations for the ten problems described bellow. Ideally, you should email the solutions at `lsz@lorandszakacs.com`, please include the text `PLDA` in the subject line (so I can pipe the emails to /dev/null :innocent:).

This homework is not graded, but it is *required*, you will receive feedback on how to write things better on a case by case basis.  

Late submissions are accepted only in special circumstances. No general rule applies for this homework.

The task at hand
-------------------------------------------------------------

Please pick 10 problems, no additional constraints, from this set of [99 Haskell problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems). The goal of this homework is _*not*_ to test your mad programming skills, but rather to familiarize you with the basic syntax, and semantics of Haskell so that they don't become a burden when the times comes for you to actually show off :smirk:.  

Simply include the problem number, and description of the problem in the comments.  

By cheating on this homework you really are shooting yourself in the foot, and choosing to be a real pain to your fellow instructors. Please be considerate, and do your due-diligence in order for the flow of the course to be unimpeded by the, trivially solved, problem of unfamiliarity with syntax.  

Cheating on the non-practice homework assignments will be punished with a failed lab. No contest.  

Good luck!
